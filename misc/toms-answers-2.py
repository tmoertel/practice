#
# (1) If there exist in xs two elements x[i] and x[j], such that i < j
#     <= len(xs) and x[i] + x[j] == t, then do_pairs_sum_to will
#     return True.
#
# (2) If not, it will return False.
#
# Proof of (1).  Proceed by contradiction.  Assume (a) that x[i] +
# x[j] == t, for some i < j, and (b) that the function returned False.
# Since the function didn't return True, we infer that t - x[j] must
# not have been previously seen when the function vistied element j.
# But, since i < j and by (a) we know x[i] equals t - x[j], t - x[j]
# must have been seen before, leading to a contradiction.
#
# Proof of (2). Again, by contradiction.  Assume (a) that there exist
# no indices i and j, such that i < j and x[i] + x[j] == t and (b)
# that the function returned True.  If the function returned True,
# there must have been some j for which t - x[j] was previously seen.
# Therefore, there must have been some i < j such that x[i] = t - x[j].
# But this contradicts (a).
