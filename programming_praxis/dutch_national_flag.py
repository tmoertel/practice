"""Solve Dijkstra's "Dutch National Flag" problem.

# Our stategy is to partition A into red, mid, and blue segments,
# where the red segment A[:red] contains exclusively 'r' values, and
# the blue segment A[blue:] contains exclusively 'b' values.  The mid
# segment A[red:blue] contains everything else, partitioned by i:
# A[blue:i] are values known to be 'w', and A[i:red} are unexamined
# values. Initially, then, the unexamined mid segment owns the entire
# array, but as we examine elements we swap them into the red and blue
# segments, which grow correspondingly.  When we've examined all of
# the elements, there will be no unexamined elements in the mid
# segment, which must therefore be all 'w' values; hence the array
# will be sorted by color (into the 'r', 'w', 'b' order of the Dutch
# National Flag).
