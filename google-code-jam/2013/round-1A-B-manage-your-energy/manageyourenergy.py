"""Solution to "Manage Your Energy" Code Jam problem
http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/2418487/dashboard#s=p1

Claim: If for problem size k - 1 we know (1) the maximum gain g_{k-1},
(2) how much energy e is available afterward (including recharge), and
also (3) how much input slack s_i remains in each previous activity i
< k, we can extend the solution to size k by filling k's input slack
s_k = E - e to the maximum extent possible with energy taken from the
least-valuable activities i < k for which v_i < v_k and for which all
the activities j in between have non-zero slacks to allow for energy
transfer. We call such a transfer a "trade." Each bit transferred from
i, however, reduces the available slack in activities j, until one of
the slacks s_j reaches 0, sealing off all activities < j from
participation in future trades.
