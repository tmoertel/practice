"""Solution to "Kingdom Rush" Code Jam problem
http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/1645485/dashboard#s=p1

Claims:

Each level must be visited at least once.  Thus the minimum number of
visits is achieved when we minimize the number of levels that must be
visited twice.  Thus we must maximize the number of levels that can be
played with a 2-star rating on their first visit, eliminating the need
to visit them again.  Because the count of stars we have collected is
increasing, and therefore smallest at the outset, we must process
levels in increasing order of 2-star-rating requirement, so that the
smallest requirements are encountered earliest.

But when we don't have enough stars to take the next level at the
2-star requirement, we must select a level at the 1-star requirement.
Then, by similar logic, we should select the level eligible for 1-star
play that has the *highest* requirement for 2-star play.  Since we are
forced to "burn" a level's opportunity for 2-star play on its first
encounter, we must burn the level with the least opportunity; this
preserves all the other levels' opportunities, which are better (or at
least no worse).
