"""Solution to "Searching a Maze", problem 16.1 from EPI v. 1.3.1.

"Problem 16.1: Given a 2D array of black and white entries
representing a maze with designated entrance and exit points, find a
path from the entrance to the exit, if one exists."  Source: _Elements
of Programming Interviews_, v. 1.3.1.

Discussion.  The first problem is how to represent a maze.  The
problem statement says that we will be given a 2D array of black and
white cells.  Presumably we are also given the identifiers of a source
cell and an exit cell.  So we will represent a maze as the triple

    (A, s, e)

where A is an array of Boolean values, in which True represents white
cells and False black, and s and e are the indices into the array
giving the source and destination cells.

The array A can be seen as representing a graph in which each white
cell is connected to its white neighbors.  A path from source to exit
exists in the maze iff there is a path from the source to the exit in
the graph.  To solve the problem then, I'll interpret the array A as a
graph and use a breadth-first search from s, looking for e.  Using BFS
ensures that no path of length N + 1 is considered before all paths of
length N have been exhausted.  From this property it follows that, if
the exit is encountered during the search, the path to it (given by
the search predecessor relationship) is minimal.
