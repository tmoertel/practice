"""Solution to "Find First Occurrence", problem 11.1 in EPI.

"Problem 11.1 : Write a method that takes a sorted array A and a key k
and returns the index of the first occurrence of k in A. Return -1 if
k does not appear in A."  Source: _Elements of Programming
Interviews._

Discussion.  This function requires a straightforward binary search.
The only wrinkle is that if a matching element is found, we cannot be
certain that it is the left-most matching element and must search
leftward.  This we could do with a linear search but, in the worst
case when all of the elements in the array match, this leads to
linear-time performance.  So it is best to use another binary search
to find the left-most match.  But this second search can be folded
into the first.  Compare the first and second implementations below to
see how it is done.  Both have the desired O(log N) runtime to find a
match within an array of length N.
